# About

This project was designed out of a need to have a visible reminder to my wife to take her medications.  While learning how to program the ESP8266 with a small set of addressable RGB LEDs (NEOPIXELS) and a touch button, it occurred to me that this is something that could be of use to others, so I started exploring how to distribute ESPHome projects which has led me here.
